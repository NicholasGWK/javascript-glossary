### Contributions Welcome!

To contribute, just fork and submit a PR. The goal here is conciseness and HIGH LEVEL explanations of general and simple terms. Please try to limit text for a term to a few sentences without code examples. Please include links to other glossary terms if your description uses them; this way someone new to Javascript can navigate through terms easily as needed. Example:

#### Webpack
Webpack is a highly configurable [module](#module) [bundler](#bundler)

#### Module
